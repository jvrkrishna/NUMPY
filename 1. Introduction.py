############# NUMPY ################
'''NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful library in Python used for numerical computations. While Python supports basic mathematical operations (like addition, subtraction, multiplication, exponentiation, square root, etc.), NumPy enables more complex operations such as:
. Linear algebra
. Statistics
. Multidimensional array manipulation
. Fourier transforms, and more

✅ Why Learn NumPy?
. It's the foundational library for AI & Machine Learning.
. It supports fast, vectorized operations on large datasets.
. Most popular libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, OpenCV, Plotly) depend on NumPy.

If you're working on numerical or scientific computing, NumPy is essential.

🧑‍💻 History of NumPy
Created by: Travis Oliphant
Released in: 2005
Written in: Python and C (which makes it both flexible and fast)

🌟 Key Features of NumPy
✅ Free & Open Source
🚀 Extremely Fast (thanks to underlying C code)
💾 Memory Efficient
👨‍💻 Developer Friendly
🔁 Supports Vectorized Operations (no need for explicit loops)
🔄 Great alternative to MATLAB, which is not open source
